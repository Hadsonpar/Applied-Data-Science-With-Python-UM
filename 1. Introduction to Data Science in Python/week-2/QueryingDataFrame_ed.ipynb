    "# Querying `DataFrame`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we're going to talk about querying DataFrames. The first step in the process is to understand Boolean masking. Boolean masking is the heart of fast and efficient querying in numpy and pandas, and it's analogous to bit masking used in other areas of computational science. By the end of this lecture you'll understand how Boolean masking works, and how to apply this to a DataFrame to get out data you're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Boolean mask is an array which can be of one dimension like a series, or two dimensions like a data frame, where each of the values in the array are either true or false. This array is essentially overlaid on top of the data structure that we're querying. And any cell aligned with the true value will be admitted into our final result, and any cell aligned with a false value will not."
